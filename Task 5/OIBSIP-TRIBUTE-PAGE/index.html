              Edward Christopher Sheeran born 17 February 1991 is an English
              singer-songwriter. Born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, and raised in
              Framlingham, Suffolk, he began writing songs around the age of
              eleven. In early 2011, Sheeran independently released the extended
              play No. 5 Collaborations Project. He signed with Asylum Records
              the same year.

              Sheeran's debut album, + ("Plus"), was released in September 2011

              "The A Team". In 2012, Sheeran won the Brit Awards for Best

              second-best-selling album worldwide of 2015. In the same year, ×
              won Album of the Year at the 2015 Brit Awards, and he received the
              Ivor Novello Award for Songwriter of the Year from the British
              Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. A single from ×,
              "Thinking Out Loud", earned him the 2016 Grammy Awards for Song of
              the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance.
            </li>

              Sheeran's third album, ÷ ("Divide"), was released in March 2017,
              and was the best-selling album worldwide of 2017. The first two
              singles from the album, "Shape of You" and "Castle on the Hill",
              broke records in a number of countries by debuting in the top two
              positions of the charts. He also became the first artist to have
              two songs debut in the US top 10 in the same week. By March 2017,
              Sheeran had accumulated ten top-10 singles from ÷ on the UK
              Singles Chart, breaking the record for most top-10 UK singles from
              one album. His fourth single from ÷, "Perfect", reached number one
              in the US, Australia, and the UK, where it became the Christmas
              number one in 2017. The world's best-selling artist of 2017, he
              was named the Global Recording Artist of the Year. Released in
              2019, his fourth overall and first collaborative album, No.6
              Collaborations Project, debuted at number one in most major
              markets, and spawned three UK number one singles, "I Don't Care",
              "Beautiful People", and "Take Me Back to London". His fifth studio
              album, = ("Equals"), topped the charts in most major markets in
              2021. His sixth album, - ("Subtract"), was released on 5 May 2023,
              while his seventh album, Autumn Variations, was released on 29
              September 2023 under his own record label, Gingerbread Man

              Sheeran has sold more than 150 million records worldwide, making
              him one of the world's best-selling music artists.[2] He has 101
              million RIAA-certified units in the US,[3] and two of his albums
              are in the list of the best-selling albums in UK chart history. In
              December 2019, the Official Charts Company named him artist of the
              decade, with the most combined success in the UK album and singles
              charts in the 2010s.[4] As of April 2022, he is the most followed
              artist on Spotify.[5] Beginning in March 2017, his ÷ Tour became
              the highest-grossing of all time in August 2019. An alumnus of the
              National Youth Theatre in London, Sheeran's acting roles include
              appearing in the 2019 film Yesterday, playing himself.

              On 25 June 2021, Sheeran released "Bad Habits", the lead single
              from his upcoming fifth studio album.[171] His 10th UK number one
              single, the song spent eleven consecutive weeks at the top of the
              UK Singles Chart and Irish Singles Chart, topped the charts in
              Australia, Canada and Germany among others, and peaked at number
              two on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US.[172][173] His eleventh
              week at number one in the UK saw him become the first British solo
              artist to notch up 52 weeks at Number 1 across his catalogue, with
              only Elvis Presley (80 weeks) and The Beatles (69 weeks) achieving
              more weeks at the summit.[174] On 19 August, Sheeran announced
              that his fifth studio album, = ("Equals"), would be released on 29
              October 2021. The cover was painted by him during the first
              COVID-19 lockdown, and is based on the changes his life had during
              the last four years, including marriage, having a child and losing
              friends. The promotional single "Visiting Hours" was released
              alongside the announcement.[175] On 9 September, he was part of
              the 2021 Kickoff Experience ahead of the American NFL season
              opening game.[176] Released on 10 September, "Shivers" dethroned
              "Bad Habits" at the top of the UK and Irish singles charts.[177]
              Topping the charts in most major markets, = became his fifth UK
              number-one album, and fourth US number one.[178][179]

              On 29 November 2021, Sheeran and Elton John released "Merry
              Christmas", a duet single for charity. Inspired by a scene from
              the 2003 romantic-comedy film Love Actually, the song's music
              video sees the duo pay homage to scenes from past British
              Christmas hits, including "Last Christmas", "Walking in the Air",
              "Merry Christmas Everyone", and "Stay Another Day".[180][181] All
              of the UK profits from the song went to the Ed Sheeran Suffolk
              Music Foundation and the Elton John AIDS Foundation.[181] Debuting
              at number one in the UK Singles Chart on 10 December, it was
              Sheeran's 12th chart-topper.[182] On 23 December, Sheeran featured
              on the remix of Fireboy DML's song "Peru".[183] On 11 February
              2022, Sheeran released a duet version of "The Joker and the Queen"
              featuring Taylor Swift.[184] On 4 March, he featured in "Bam Bam",
              collaborating for the second time with Camila Cabello. Later that
              month he collaborated with Colombian singer J Balvin in the
              singles "Sigue" and "Forever My Love". Sheeran commenced his +–=÷x
              Tour (Mathematics Tour) on 21 March.[185] He played warm-up shows

              April, Sheeran released the fifth single from =, "2step" featuring
              Lil Baby, before releasing a version of the song featuring
              Ukrainian pop-rock band Antytila.[187] 2022 also saw Sheeran
              venture into heavier styles of music, releasing a new version of
              "Bad Habits" with the pop metal group Bring Me the Horizon in
              February.[188] Later that year it was reported that he was in
              contact with Suffolk extreme metal group Cradle of Filth over a
              possible project, with frontman Dani Filth confirming progress on
              the collaboration in August.[189] In July, he launched a
              collaboration with clothing brand Lucy & Yak which was inspired by
              the artwork of =.[190] On 29 September, Sheeran released the
              single "Celestial", a collaboration with Japanese media franchise
              Pokémon. On November, "Shivers" became Sheeran's 11th song to
              reach 1 billion streams on Spotify. He celebrated via an Instagram
              post, saying that he was currently filming a music video for his
              next album, scheduled to be released the following year.[191]
              Sheeran was spotted at a beach in the coastal Suffolk town of
              Lowestoft.

              four albums have spent a combined 41 weeks at number one in the
              UK, the most weeks at number one in the UK Album Charts in the

              Sheeran co-wrote country music singer Kenny Chesney's single "Tip
              of My Tongue".[168] In December 2019, Sheeran was named artist of
              the decade by the Official Charts Company for being the most
              successful performer in the UK album and singles charts of the
              2010s.[4] Eight of his songs featured in the Official Chart
              Company's chart of the decade with three songs inside the top
